I'm Andrey Grechin, a customer-focused IT professional with 20+ years of experience and broad knowledge of IT who translates business goals to technical solutions through individual attention and relationship building. I'm incredibly passionate about Cisco's portfolio, infrastructure and network architectures, system design, cloud-native and cloud-hybrid solutions, DevOps practices, programmability, and APIs.

I have extensive experience in IT infrastructures, data centers, enterprise networking, collaboration, security, computing, and IoT design. I'm also pioneering the Cisco DevNet program, including programmability, automation with solid connections to DevOps practices and tools, and cloud-native and cloud-hybrid technologies. I teach partners and customers and help them with onboarding to the program.

As a Cisco Business Architecture Transformation Program alumnus, I conduct gap analysis, connect business goals to technical solutions and incremental capabilities, and define digital transformation roadmaps and implementation projects.

I always believe in continuous learning and development in focus and prospective areas. These areas include cloud and hybrid architectures, system design, cloud-native architectures, containerization, DevOps instruments and practices, network automation, testing, and programmability.
